NeuroMLToPOV-Ray
================

Converting NeuroML v1&amp;2 files to POV-Ray: http://www.povray.org

** Still in development!! Use with caution! **


Experimental implementation for converting NeuroML (cells & network structure) to POVRay files.

This version uses Python (minidom) based parser which generates POVRay files directly...

An improvement would be to use a SAX based parser...

NOTE: doesn't (yet) use libNeuroML as there is a need to support NeuroML v1&2 (libNeuroML is currently only for v2) 

To get a feel for the usage of this tool, install POVRay (http://www.povray.org) and try running ./test.sh
